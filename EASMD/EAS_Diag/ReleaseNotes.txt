Version 2.0 RTW
- GitHub here we go! Source is open! That deserves the major version upgrade.
- License is now GPLv2.
- Replaced the WBXML dll with a version from a different code base (easweb.codeplex.com). Basically the same, but with some bugs squashed.
- Retargeted the solution to use .Net 4.5.1
- Fixed a typo initializing the Exchange Server version list ("14..1" should be "14.1")
- Resized the input/output boxes on the base64 tab. (Increased the width.)
- Disabled/hid Base64 option from the output box.
- Fixed a couple of texts.
- Added link to GitHub repo.

Version 1.71 RTW:
- Changed Exchange 15 option to Exchange 2013 (Final name). Protocol level stays at 14.1.

Version 1.7 RTW:
- Added support for Exchange 15 (currently in Beta). Note that currently there is no new protocol level so choosing Exchange 15 will be the same as choosing 14.1.
- Moved the "Autodiscover" and "WBXML Utility" tabs to the left (assuming they will be more frequently used options).

Version 1.6 RTW:
- Added WBXML tab for inputting raw WBXML (and corresponding output).
- Added WBXML as an output option for the "Full test".
- Changed default output to WBXML.
- Changed 'BackColor' property to "Window" for all output Windows.

Version 1.4 RTW:
- Added Client Certificate Password text box (for pfx-files).
- Added ActiveSync Autodiscover tests. (Please note that SRV record support is not added yet, and thus disabled in the UI.)
- Added scrollbars to output windows.
- Added possibility to use both domain\user and user@domain.com (leave "Domain" textbox empty to use the latter).
- Added support for parsing out the redirect on a HTTP 451.
- Added handling of HTTP 302.
- Added explanation for HTTP 502.
- Added explanation for HTTP 504.
- Disabled "Hex" view option on Main tab. (Code still present, but not sure if this is actually useful, so it's not active in the UI.)
- Re-designed how HTTP status codes are shown in the output view. (Parses out the individual HTTP codes for errors.)
- Changed default protocol version to 12.1 (Exchange 2007 SPx).
- Major code refactoring.
- Fixed minor bugs.
- Minor changes in the UI.
- Added about tab. (Easier to identify the version you're running.)
