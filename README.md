EAS MD
=====
## A diagnostic utility for verifying and troubleshooting Exchange ActiveSync 
EAS MD is a desktop application that will let you perform ActiveSync commands against Exchange like a mobile client. This is intented as a diagnostic utility that will let you troubleshoot issues in your Exchange ActiveSync deployment.

This solution is split into two parts; EAS_Diag which is the actual app and interface, and EAS_Protocol which handles conversion to WBXML and the "back-end" of the protocol.
